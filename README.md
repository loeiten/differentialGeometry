# Differential geometry
Presented here is a short note about differential geometry for physisists (in
particular plasma physists). For a plasma physisist with little or no background
in general relativity it can be hard to find easy litterature about the topic,
and one often need to search to several sources to get a grasp of basic
concepts. The text here is intended to patch the concepts found in the
different sources into one text. It is also a trial to cover the gap between
what can be found in sources relying on heavier mathematics and what one
typically need to understand for a everyday use as a physisist.

Found here is
* [notes_about_differential_geometry](/notes_about_differential_geometry/)
  The folder containing the .tex file used to create the pdf of the notes

* [diff_geom_calculations_with_python/](/notes_about_differential_geometry/)
  NOTE: This needs some review, and is for now only intended for personal
  useage. It contains some .py files used to check out some of the concepts
  discussed in the text
